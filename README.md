# livecoffeeapp
Deployed MEAN Stack server and API included. 

MEAN stack application. Work in Progress.

Just some routes up and user auth for coffee roasters. The app is currently just up to demonstrate abilities in MEAN stack and that I do have deployment experience. 

Angular Front-End with RestAPI Node.js server

This is the starting production of the coffee app.

-Used Mongoose for MongoDB -Basic Routes are there for CRUD. Currently, on Heroku as I would like to show this to some local coffee roasters and see what they think about the possibilities for an APP like this. Once I get a better idea of how shops would like to interact with consumers before really building the database schema and how regular users should use the app. Obviously, to be able to search for coffee types and different drinks at shops, but looking through research there are other factors we may want to include.

As a coffee drinker who consumes considerably less beer than I used to it would be nice to have an app like UNTAPPD for coffee. I find myself generally buying the same coffee though I do like a variety of roasts and flavors. I also like trying a variety of coffee drinks when I go to a coffee shop.

Considering the global scale of coffee and the statistics for it, I don't think it would be too hard to get an app like this off the ground if the right promotions for said app made it interesting for the consumer. I chose a pirate/treasure hunt theme for now, but theme can easily be changed if it's not appreciated by potentials users.

If you are reading this and you would like to go past to the roaster page please use Username: test2@test.com Password: password1 to login. It will take you to the roaster page where you can see the set up for a roaster to add their name and from there to add coffee. I don't have a lot of storage space, nor do I want to be paying for any if it's not a functioning app. I have better things to do with my time then to consistently go into Mongo Atlas and delete stuff so please use the Test username.

Thanks for looking and if you have any further ideas for this please feel free to contact me.
